# basic-javascript-mini-projects

Beginner-level JavaScript projects to get the ball rolling.

The objective of this project is to do several small and simple applications completely on my own. From here, more complex projects can be tackled. These projects will likely not be part of any portfolio, but they will get me on the path of building my own projects.

The first 5 projects of this app will be:

1. To-Do App
2. Expense Tracker
3. Note-Taking App
4. Vowel Counter
5. Memory Game

These apps will be of very simplistic functionality. They will only be hosted on a local machine. I will likely not be adding any memory storage between sessions.

## Project Outlines:
